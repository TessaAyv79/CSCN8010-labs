# Project Title: Performance Metrics for Classification
## Author: Tessa Ayvazoglu
## Date: February 24, 2024
## Course: Foundations of Machine Learning Frameworks - CSCN8010


**PURPOSE:**

The purpose of this lab is to evaluate a model for MNIST classification using performance metrics for classification problems. The specific objectives of the lab are as follows:

1. <span style="color:purple">**Data Preparation:**</span> Download the MNIST dataset and perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the characteristics of the data.

2. <span style="color:purple">**Dataset Modification:**</span> Choose the number of classes for classification, ensuring alignment between the target object and the features.

3. <span style="color:purple">**Dataset Splitting:**</span> Split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets.

4. <span style="color:purple">**Model Selection and Training:**</span> Choose a classification model from a Kaggle notebook and train it on the training data.

5. <span style="color:purple">**Evaluation on Validation Set:**</span> Assess the model's performance on the validation dataset using various metrics, including accuracy, confusion matrix, precision, recall, and F1 score for each class. Additionally, generate a precision-recall curve for one class versus all others.

6. <span style="color:purple">**Precision Improvement:**</span> Provide insights and numerical Python examples for increasing precision for the chosen class without retraining the model.

7. <span style="color:purple">**Recall Improvement:**</span> Provide insights and numerical Python examples for increasing recall for the chosen class without retraining the model.

8. <span style="color:purple">**Evaluation on Test Set:**</span> Apply the trained model to the test set and draw conclusions based on its performance.
